# PracticalMachineLearning
This repository contains files related to the final assignment for the Practical Machine Learning course.
Unfortunately, I did not get the actual html file committed.  I am not adequately skilled with GitHub to do the compiled html
and other commands. Sigh.
Please review the "Create File Final Report."  The figures mentioned there are in the other posted files.  You can 
ignore the Final Report html file.  It has the html code but is not compiled.
